### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
There has been an increase in bike riding and people are using shared bikes more for this purpose. In turn this has led to an increase in the **bike-share systems** which allow users to rent :bike: from source to destination at a small price :dollar:. People can return the bikes either at the source or the destination or at any dock in between the source and destination. People can use this service at any time around the year.
Users need to unlock a bicycle from their source dock and they can record when they end their journey and return the bicycle at their destination dock. All this is done via online systems. A lot of information gets collected in this process which can be very useful for the system providers to understand the usage pattern and improve their services.
This project explores all such data collected from bicycle-sharing system. The data used here is provided by [Motivate](https://www.motivateco.com/) which is a bike share system provider for many major cities in the United Sates. Specifically, this project compares usage patterns between three large cities: **Chicago, New York City and Washington, DC.**

 In this project we import bike-share data for three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City and Washington, DC. It then provides insights in this data in an interactive way. For each city user can get information like ***popular times of travel, popular trips, trip durations, user profile.*** User can also view the data as is (in its raw form). The information is displayed on a terminal and is based on the user's inputs. Terminal will display below set of questions to a user:

1. Would you like to see data for Chicago, New York or Washington
2. Would you like to filter the data by month, day, both or not at all?
3. (If they chose month) Which month - January, February, March, April, May, or June?
4. (If they chose day) Which day - Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, or   Sunday?

Based on user's inputs to the above questions the information will be displayed on the terminal.
